    <td><p><strong>A.</strong> CRE CC Encryption Manager relies on services provided by the operating system to function. This is because various governments regulate the availability and usage of security technology including encryption. The test portion of CRE CC Encryption is intended to ensure that encryption algorithms and modes selected for use are available and functioning properly. It can also be used to identify other algorithms and modes that can be used by this program. We begin by displaying a table of available encryption methods and modes. <br>
        <IMG SRC="includes/languages/english/help/encrypt/images/test1.png" NAME="graphics4" WIDTH="825" HEIGHT="140" hspace="5" vspace="5" BORDER=1> </p>
      <p><strong>B.</strong> The first part of the encryption service test is shown above, and lists the available methods and what modes are working on your web server. If you do not see a table similar to the one above then you do not have mcrypt installed or working correctly. <font face="Arial"><br>
      <IMG SRC="includes/languages/english/help/encrypt/images/test2.png" NAME="graphics4" WIDTH="274" HEIGHT="213" hspace="5" vspace="5" BORDER=1> </p>
      <p><strong>C.</strong> Then a partial list of the second part is shown above, it lists the length of the key that is allowed or required for a specific method. Currently this tool provides only some basic information. In future, it will be expanded to allow users to select an algorithm to fit their needs and even to allow switching algorithms as part of a carefully managed security system.      </p>
