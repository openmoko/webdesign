<p>
<font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10pt;">&nbsp;<b> 1. Introduction:</b> Data feed service is
based on Calvin K's data feed contribution. The basic functions were retained
but the rest of the internal code was changed to follow OSC Style of coding.
Along with the coding change an&nbsp;admin interface was introduced to manage
the feed configuration. With these coding changed and the addition of a admin
the process was split into 4 steps. Not all of the steps are required for each
feed you do.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10pt;">&nbsp; <b>2. Goals:</b><br>The typical store owner never needs to edit a code or define file directly.The store
owner does not need a lot of support on how to use program. Combines the functions
of moving data in and out of store is in one area. Make it flexible enough for
small, medium and large store to use program effectively. Move program files closer
to OSC/CRE Loaded standards for look and feel, and coding.<br><br>
