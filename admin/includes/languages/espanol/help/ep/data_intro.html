<p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10pt;">
&nbsp;<b> 1. Introduction:</b> Data feed service is a collection of contributions to allow you to updated
your products and categories data remotely, and send that data to data listing
services. It uses a number of contributions that have been modified to work
better with small, medium, and large stores. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10pt;">
&nbsp; <b>2. Goals:</b><br>The typical store owner never needs to edit a code or define file directly.The store
owner does not need a lot of support on how to use program.Combines the functions
of moving data in and out of store is in one area. Make it flexable enough for
small, medium and large store to use program effectivly. Move program files closer
to OSC/Cre Loaded standerds for look and feel, and codeing.<br><br>
&nbsp; <b>3. Parts of Data Feed Service:</b><br>
Easy Populate Advance enhanced by Tom O'Neill<br>
Easy Populate Basic enhanced by Tom O'Neill<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Easy Populate: This is used to update product and category data, it allows
you to updated data remotely on your&nbsp;local computer and upload to the data
to your on line store.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Easy Populate Advance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy Populate Advance
uses products_id instead of products_model to tie the rows in the Import/Export
file to your database. This is significate since you now can delete items, asigning
products to multiple categories, refine export files to select records you need
to edit/update There also has been asignificant speed and record handling capibilities
added to both Advance and Basic version. The numbers below are from recent test
done, previously Easy populate could only handle 300 to 400 records max.

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Easy Populate Basic<br>
 Easy Populate basuc is for back ward compatiblity with  EP 2.XX version of Easy populate.
This is because EP used modle numbers to tie you file  back to the database. Where in the advance
version it used product_id.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Increase in speed and record handling<br></span></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10pt;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  a. Using only stock products<br>
export EPB ~ 32 records 0.173231 seconds file size 26kb<br>
import EPB ~32 records 1.844497 seconds file size 26kb<br>
export EPA~ 32 records 0.790210 seconds file size 26kb<br>
import EPA~ 32 records 1.759426 seconds file size 26kb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  b. Using 2033 products in a single file<br>
import EPA 89.927511 second &nbsp;or 1 minute 30 sec file size 2.800 KB<br>
import EPB 456.582260 second &nbsp;or 7 minutes and 36 sec file size 3,423 KB<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  c. Deleting products:2033 products added<br>
delete EPA 68.877599 seconds File size was 2,875 KB<br>
EPB cannot delete records.&nbsp;<br><br>
&nbsp;b. Data feed:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Data feed takes the data with in your catalog and prepares it for submission to a feed &nbsp;service and send it to the feed
service either automaticly or manualy if you need on completion&nbsp;of building the feed.<br>&nbsp;<br>
