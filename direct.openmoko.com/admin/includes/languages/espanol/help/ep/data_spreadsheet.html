<b>How to do specific task with the files in Easy Populate Advance:</b><br><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Adding new products:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  a. To add products the product id should be 0, there can be many 0's for product ID's 
  as needed. The code will detect the 0 as a new product and auto increment the 
  products_id.
  <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  b. If the products_id number is left blank then the product is not added. You can also 
  insert you own product ID. they do not have to be sequncial. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  c. If you need to specify your own unique products_ID, and it does not exist in the data
  base it will be added as a new product. Make sure you add the correct categories, 
  other wise you will need to use the move product to a new category procedure.
<br>
Example:
<br>
I have a previous inventory software that has already assigned product ID's they are
<br>
12001
15001
14
2000
<br>
These can be used by simply putting the in the v-product_id column.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Adding linked products (Yes Version 3.01 can handle linked products):
A linked product is having one product record set, but having it show in multiple 
categories.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  a. For a product you want to link to another category 
Create a download using complete or model/category in the  Select fields to download
you can limit the list by using the filter settings.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  b. Import into the spead sheet program.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Copy the original product line to a new line<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Change only category information where you want the product linked to.
    Leaving the v_product_id unchanged.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Save the file and re upload<br>
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3.Deleting products (This has been added back for products only):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  a. Single product not linked
<br>

all the way to the left. In this column add delete for each product you which to delete.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  b. Deleting linked product:
 Do a download that has all of the links for the product 
cut the paste th item you which do remove in front of the product links to remain.
In the v_action column enter delete for the link you want to remove.
<br>
Note: the deleted item must be listed first. The product to remain must be list after the
product link you are deleting.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Moving a product between two categories
  In the spread sheet program
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   1. copy the line for the product to a new line
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   2. on the original line type in delete in the v_action column
