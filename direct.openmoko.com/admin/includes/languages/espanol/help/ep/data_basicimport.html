<b>Upload EP File for Import</b>
  </td>

<tr>
 <td>
To import a file into your catalog it must be first generated or in EPB format. This is
the products_model is the first column in the upload file. The file should have EPB as the first
three characters in its file name or none at all.

Click on the browse button to browse your local computer for the file to upload and insert.
Upload will move the file from you local computer to the web server and import the data in the files to your
databases. There is usually a limit within php which prevents files larger then 2mb from being uploaded. Also
EP usually will only imports 400 to 500 lines of products, this version can do 2,000 plus.
If a file it to large to upload because of PHP restrictions the FTP the file to the site and use
"Import Data from file in temp/"
