<br><b>Upload EP File for Import</b> <br>
This feature allows the upload of a delimited file for import into the database. You can now import files which include HTML in the text fields without having the file mangled by EP or Excel.  But EP Basic will not install files unless the file name begins with EPB or EP.  Files beginning with EPA are intended for use with EasyPopulate Advanced.

<br><b>Upload and Split a EP File</b> <br>
This feature has the same improvements applied to the Import routines, but allows you to upload a large file and split it into smaller pieces.  This feature is helpful in avoiding interrupted imports due to communications timeouts or exceeding the servers script time limits.


<br><b>Import Data from file in temp/</b> <br>
This is now a drop down list of all the files located in the /temp directory. 

<br><b>Create an export files</b> <br>
A series of drop down boxes are used to allow you to :

<br><b>Select method to save export file </b> <br>
There are two selections here:<br>
       Save to temp file on server<br>
       Select fields to download<br>


<br><b>Select fields to download </b> <br>
This is the list of which download types to use. You will also notice that there is no V_products_id in the list. This is for backward compatibility of older files.

By default the file types are are:
Complete     (Attributes have been removed since there is a separate download for those.)
