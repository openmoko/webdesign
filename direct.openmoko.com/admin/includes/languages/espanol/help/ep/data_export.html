The changes here are in the handling of HTML content in descriptions; image path URL's,
and EP import filename requirements. You may now import files with html in the text
fields and not have it mangled by EP or Excel.  URL's for images in subdirectories
can be handled and correctly written to the database.   Beginning with 2.75, EP
Advanced will not install files unless it begins with EPA,and EP Basic will not
install files that begin with EPA.  This feature is to protect the database from
errors related to a new column added to the Easy populate file format.  EP Advanced
uses the product_id column, this allow for more features to be added. EPA is will also allow
you to refine your export file so you can target a specific group of records to edit
