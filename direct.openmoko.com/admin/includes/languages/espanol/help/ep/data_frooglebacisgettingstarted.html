<br>
&nbsp;Step 1: Sign in to the Froogle Merchant Center
Create or use an existing Google Account to enter the Froogle Merchant Center.

You must go to
<a href="https://www.google.com/froogle/merchants/welcome">https://www.google.com/froogle/merchants/welcome</a>

From here there is a link to &quot; create an account now. &quot;

You need to follow these pages and signup for a new account if you do not have one.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Step 2: Create an FTP account
:<br>Set up your FTP account, which you'll use to upload your feeds to us.
Do this in your froogle merchant account

<br><br> &nbsp;Step 3: Specify your feed's settings in the catalog admin:<br>
Log into your stores admin and go to the  Data Input Output Systems box in the left hand
column. From here you will see the feeds main screen. You can either click on the run bottom
next to configure or click on the data configure in the left hand column.  These setting are
transferred to the froogle admin in the cart

<br><br> &nbsp;Step 4: Set Categories in the catalog admin:
<br>Once you have setup the configuration you will need to return to the &quot;Data Feeds&quot; screen. Here
you will need to build your categories for the feed. Since this is a intense process  it is a separate step.
You need to do this once and then again only if you change your categories.
It was done this way for larger stores to reduce processing time.
<br><br>
&nbsp;Step 5: Pre Feed Process in the catalog admin:
<br>This set will Build the actual file for submission to Froogle. If this process take more then
60 Second then you have a medium to large store or there is a problem. Compared the feed
you built in the step to the sample one called /doc/sample_text.txt in the contribution.

<br><br> &nbsp;Step 6: Submitting the feed in the catalog admin:
<br>There are two methods to submit the feed to Froogle. The first is via direct FTP, this is where the FTP information you
entered into the configuration is used and the feed file is sent directly to Froogle. Or you down load the feed
and FTP from your local computer to froogle.
<br><br>
&nbsp;Step 7: Check your feed for errors:<br>
Sign in to your Froogle Merchant Center account to check for any formatting errors in your feed.
Log back into your merchant account at Froogle<br><br>.
