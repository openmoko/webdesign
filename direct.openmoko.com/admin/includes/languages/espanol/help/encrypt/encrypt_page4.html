      <p><strong>B.</strong> You will now have encrypted this existing entry. Do this for each unencrypted CC number. Next to the encrypt button is a decrypt button that can be used to decrypt the information. Attempts to re-encrypt a number again will fail.<br>

      <p><strong>C.</strong> Mass Encryption or Decryption can also be done. Simply click on the encrypt or decrypt buttons at the top of the form and all numbers will be processed. The program will detect those orders that have already been encrypted or decrypted and change only the data which requires processing.        <BR>

      <p><strong>D.</strong> If you need to export your Credit card information to an external program that cannot use the mcrypt library you can decrypt all of the encrypted data before exporting the information. Once you have exported the data you should return to this screen to encrypt all data. <BR>
