    <td><p><strong>A.</strong> Keys should be changed from time to time as a security precaution. When you first set up your &quot;Primary key file&quot; an empty &quot;New key file&quot; was created. In fact, CRE Loaded comes with 2 key files already in place, just in case your host allows editing of existing files but restricts creation of files from within the web server. You will now need to add your new key to this file . In the row that is labeled &quot;New key file&quot; click on the edit button.<br>

      <p> <strong><font color="#FF0000"> WARNING:</font></strong><br>
        <strong><font color="#FF0000"><img src="images/icons/warning_big.gif" width="20" height="20" hspace="5" vspace="5"></font></strong>Do not edit the main key file for your site once you have begun encrypting data. This may cause the loss of any existing data you have encrypted. You must follow the procedure for converting records as listed below: </p>
      <p><strong>B.</strong> Click once on the edit button next to the new_(key file name) to access the Key File edit screen. When you click on the file name you will be sent to the key file contents editor. You may enter anything from a phrase to a random set of numbers and letters. The longer the phrase, the more secure your data will be. Inclusion of numbers and use of both upper and lower case characters will also make your phrase more difficult to guess.<br>

      <p> <strong>C.</strong> Once you have finished changing your key click on the save button. It will save the key and display it for your verification. If this is not what you wanted click on the restore button and the old contents will be brought back.</span></font> <br>

      <p><strong>D.</strong> Having placed the new key you should now go to the convert data screen to re-encrypt your data using this new key. If you do not use the Convert CC Data screen you may lose your existing CC data. This may be a permanent loss.</P>

      <p><strong>1.</strong> If the new key file is empty, you will see the above screen, with warnings that there is no key and you need to add one.<br>

      <p><strong>2.</strong> The convert button will appear once you have added a new key phrase. As long as you see no red warning messages you are ready to proceed with conversion. If you do see a warning it is important that you resolve the problem before continuing.<br>

      <p><strong>3.</strong> Click on the convert button. This will convert the existing cc data to the new key. The process converts the data by decrypting with the old key and encrypting with the new one. It continues by copying the &quot;Primary Key File&quot; to a back-up file and moving the &quot;New key file&quot; to the &quot;Primary Key File&quot;. That completes the process</span></font> </p>
