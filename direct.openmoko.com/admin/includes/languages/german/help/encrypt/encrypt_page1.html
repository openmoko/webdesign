Some prevent the use of encrypted data or software with hooks in place for encryption to be added. This module does not contain actual encryption code. It uses the mcrypt module, and provides management services. While it is not subject to export laws in the US, it may well be regulated by your jurisdiction. You are responsible for knowledge of and compliance with local laws.</font> </p>
      <p><strong><img src="images/icons/warning_big.gif" alt="Warning" width="20" height="20" hspace="5"></strong> <font color="#FF0000">One must be careful when the encryption/decryption takes place. Network service disruptions and other factors can cause loss of data availability - ie leaving data encrypted with no key available. It is important to process your cards as frequently as you can, and to delete the data as soon as the transaction is cleared.</font></p>

      <p>        Although the encryption protects the data while it is stored in the database tables. It does not protect data when you view it in the admin screens. To help with this SSL for admin was written, this should be installed in the admin and the appropriate edit screens run in ssl mode.
