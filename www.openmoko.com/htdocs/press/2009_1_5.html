During CES Openmoko will also showcase distributions that run on the FreeRunner mobile phone.</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&quot;Openmoko continues to expand its reach, giving developers a choice of operating systems for their mobile applications, and proving the FreeRunner as the hardware of choice for developers focused on building and maintaining distributions,&quot; said Openmoko Vice President of Marketing, Steve Mosher.   The company will demonstrate several distributions for the mobile hardware platform including the ever popular Debian, community-driven FDOM, QT by Trolltech (recently acquired by Nokia) and Android.</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">Since successful launch of the Openmoko FreeRunner July 2008, the company has seen expanding hardware deployment with traction in unforeseen markets including some where the mobile computing capabilities of the FreeRunner are taking precedence over its telephony functions.  These verticals include medical, industrial and military markets.  Openmoko will provide more information about these markets and demonstrations of selected applications during CES at the Lunch@Piero's press-only event January 8 and 9, 2009.</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">The Openmoko discovery initiative has grown over the past six months with FreeRunner platform development programs in universities such as MIT MediaLab, UC Berkeley, FSU and Georgia Tech in the United States as well as universities in Africa, Greece and Russia.  The renowned National Tsing Hua University of Taiwan is using Openmoko as a major teaching and researching platform in its curriculum and established the Openmoko OpenLab on its campus September 2008.  Over the past six months, FreeRunners have been sold to over 40 universities and the company has engaged in ongoing projects with the Taiwan Ministry of Education.</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">About Openmoko<br>  Openmoko is the commercial and community driven effort with a mission to create open mobile products that empower developers and consumers to personalize the devices, much like a computer, in any way they see fit.
