"It is vitally important that developers have access to this data and it improves product quality. Going forward we think that more manufacturers and more consumers will demand open architecture products with optimum performance"</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">"Why should industry be afraid of opening up its design?" asked Openmoko CEO, Sean Moss-Pultz.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Schematics are simply another form of documentation and vital to future success, service and satisfaction in the market. We believe our products would be incomplete without them."</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">"One of the freedoms we value the most is the freedom to explore. To fully understand the details of complex systems, to adapt and enhance them," said Openmoko Architect, Werner Almesberger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"We now take our commitment to openness to the next level by releasing our schematics to the public, allowing anyone to find out how the system works and how to improve it."</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">The release of the schematics will covered under a Creative Commons license and files will be posted in due course<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>on openmoko.com and openmoko.org</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">Openmoko will show the Neo FreeRunner at LinuxWorld Expo, Moscone Center, San Francisco August 5-7 at booth 1625 and at the LinuxWorld Garage 1234.</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">The Openmoko Neo FreeRunner has been selected as a finalist the LinuxWorld Product Excellence Awards, to be presented at LinuxWorld Conference &amp; Expo® this week in San Francisco.
