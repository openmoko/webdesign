Since launching the FreeRunner in July of this year, Openmoko has built out a network of more than 20 distributors covering North America, Europe and Asia. Tuxbrain, located in Barcelona Spain, is currently taking orders for the Openmoko Neo FreeRunner open source mobile phone, at an estimated price of 349.00EUR at its online store (www.tuxbrain.com).<br>  <br>  &quot;Launching an open source phone and building out a sales distribution network at the same time would have been impossible without support from the open source community,&quot; said Vice President of Marketing for Openmoko, Steven Mosher.  &quot;Only in the open source community could we find the creative support of important software contributions and the hard work of community members who literally are helping to build new businesses from the ground up. &quot;<br>  <br>  Online Community Collaboration Builds Businesses<br>  Tuxbrain began its distribution efforts in July in response to Openmoko's innovative Group Sales program which allowed community members to coordinate their purchases online and receive discounted prices by working together to get volume discounts. David Samblas, founder of Tuxbrain explains: &quot;I worked with Ruben Mendes to coordinate a group of buyers from Spain and  Portugal. The success of that effort convinced me I could create a business around this concept.&quot;<br>  <br>  Not content with merely building a business, Samblas launched an effort to bring applications to the FreeRunner, creating in the process a popular distribution known as FDOM that now supports 57 applications added to the baseline Openmoko 2008.9 distribution.  He also founded the Openmoko-Spain community list and wiki--  www.Openmoko-spain.org,<br>  where developers, users and resellers could collaborate and share ideas in Spanish.<br>  <br>  &quot;Tuxbrain exemplifies everything we hoped for when we freed the phone,&quot; according to Sean Moss Pultz CEO of Openmoko. &quot;Our goal with FreeRunner, our goal with all our products, is to free creators -- creators of software and creators of new businesses -- and strengthen the vibrant communities that support them.&quot;<br>  <br>  About Tuxbrain<br>  Founded by David Samblas and VÃ­ctor Remolina, Tuxbrain born based on a simple concept &quot;collaborate to innovate&quot;.
