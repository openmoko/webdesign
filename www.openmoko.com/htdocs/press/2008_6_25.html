Distributors will offer either the 850 MHz or 900 MHz models of the Neo Freerunner to accommodate telecommunications frequencies worldwide.</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">"We have moved beyond the early adopter stage and are now ready to release the next generation Neo Freerunner to markets where we are seeing early traction," said Steve Mosher, Openmoko vice president of marketing. "These key distributors have relationships that reach deeply into markets that can leverage the features of this remarkable mobile device and advance it even further through software and exterior customization."</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">To help developers create unique versions of the Neo Freerunner mobile phone, Openmoko recently posted CAD files for the phone's industrial design. The CAD files enable developers to design and completely modify and rapidly create prototypes for the phone case to suit their own customers' needs. Openmoko is also working with the Open Source community to expand the phone's software functionality to address the needs of high potential vertical markets such as academic, travel, science, and medicine, as well as refining the software for an eventual launch into the mass consumer market.</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">Pulster CEO, Christoph Pulster, said, "As the first official distributor for Openmoko products, we look forward to helping deliver Openmoko's latest baby, the Freerunner open mobile phone platform, into the German consumer and industrial markets."

We contribute our experience in import and trading business so that customers in European markets can buy this and future devices assured of sustained high level commercial support."</p><p class="p2"><br></p><p class="p1">Marc Stephan of TRIsoft says "Soon after we started the preorder phase after CeBit 2008, the customers response exceeded all our expectations.
